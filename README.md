In this practice let's build a **Nxt Trendz - Specific Product Details** by applying the concepts we have learned till now.

### Refer to the image below:

<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/nxt-trendz-product-details-output-v0.gif" alt="product details output" style="max-width:70%;box-shadow:0 2.8px 2.2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)">

#### Add Functionality

The app must have the following functionalities

- When an _authenticated user_ clicks on a product in the Products Route, then the page should be navigated to **Product Item Details** route.
- When the **Product Item Details** route is opened,
  - An HTTP GET request should be made to productDetailsApiUrl with `product id` as path parameter.
  - **_loader_** should be displayed while the HTTP request is fetching the data
  - After the HTTP request is successful, the response received should be displayed.
  - The quantity of the product should initially be 1.
  - The quantity of the product should be incremented by 1 when the plus icon is clicked.
  - The quantity of the product should be decremented by 1 when the minus icon is clicked.
  - The list of similar products should be displayed.
- When the **Product Item Details** route is opened, if the response received in the HTTP GET request returns the status as `404`, then the [Failure view](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/nxt-trendz-product-details-error-lg-output.png) should be displayed.
- When the **Continue Shopping** button in the [Failure view](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/nxt-trendz-product-details-error-lg-output.png) is clicked, the page should be navigated to Products Route.
- When an _unauthenticated user_ tries to access the **Product Item Details** route, the page should be navigated to Login Route
